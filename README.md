* SMS Two Factor Authentication (Dual Factor Authentication) is a security verification procedure, which is triggered through a user registeration into a website, software or application . 
* In this process, the user is automatically sent an SMS to their mobile number containing a unique numeric code.
* This 'code' is then inputted by the individual, verifying themselves as the user logging into the online account.
* This process significantly reduces the ability for online data to be compromised as only the user with the linked phone number will be able to access the account at the time.
